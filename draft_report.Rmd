## Performance of the machine learning models

### Summary metric

## Variable importance plot

### Based on top 2 models

### Ranked features among all models

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{{varimp_rank_plots.Rout.pdf}}\caption{The number of times, frequency, a given feature is ranked, on top 5, by a particular model in a given cohort as one of the most important feature. Low rank means a particular feature is predictive and hence important.}
